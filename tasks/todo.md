# 01 Design System

## Specification

- Goal: implement `context/feature-specs/01-design-system.md`.
- Scope: dark theme tokens, Oxanium font, and a temporary component preview. Keep the existing shadcn Radix components unchanged.
- Decision: reuse the installed shadcn 4.21 components and `cn()` helper instead of regenerating them.
- Acceptance: all required tokens and components render, the preview remains dark under both system themes and fits 360 px, and lint and build pass.

## Tasks

- [x] Read the spec and project context; mark the tracker in progress.
- [x] Implement theme tokens and fonts.
- [x] Build the temporary component preview.
- [x] Verify lint, build, and browser behavior at 360 px.
- [x] Update the tracker and record the review.

## Review

Implemented the dark tokens, shadcn mappings, Oxanium font, and temporary preview. Reused the seven existing generated Radix components without edits. `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass. Playwright at 360 × 640 confirmed no horizontal overflow, dark surfaces and inputs under light and dark system themes, working bottom Sheet, Oxanium and Geist Mono fonts, and no browser errors. No phone-only checks were required by this spec.

# 02 App Shell

## Specification

- Goal: implement `context/feature-specs/02-app-shell.md`.
- Scope: three placeholder routes in one mobile shell, safe-area bars, viewport metadata, manifest, and generated icons.
- Key decisions: keep navigation state in one client component; use the existing icon library and `sharp` already installed by Next.
- Acceptance: routes and active tabs work, 360 × 640 has no horizontal overflow or covered content, manifest and icons load, and lint and build pass. A real phone install check remains for the user.

## Tasks

- [x] Read the spec and project context; mark the tracker in progress.
- [x] Build route group, top bar, bottom tabs, and placeholders.
- [x] Add viewport metadata, manifest, and icons; remove starter assets.
- [x] Verify routes, navigation, manifest, assets, mobile layout, lint, and build.
- [x] Update tracker and record review.
- [ ] Confirm installed status bar and home indicator clearance on a real phone.

## Review

Built the shared shell, three placeholder routes, active bottom tabs, viewport and Apple metadata, manifest, and SVG/PNG icons. Removed the token preview and starter assets. `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass. Playwright at 360 × 640 confirmed the three routes, active tab state, no horizontal overflow, no content overlap, all icon URLs returning 200, and no console errors. Chrome's manifest parser returned no errors. The real-phone install check remains pending as required by `context/ai-workflow-rules.md`.
